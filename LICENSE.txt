------------
1. Preamble
------------

As of July 29th, 2015, I'm releasing the .gmk files for Relic Hunters Zero to the public. 

This is inspired by Derek Yu's Spelunky, which was a great example and learning tool for me. The game and the source code are being provided for the purpose of learning, entertainment and sharing. 

Commercial use is also authorized, but keep in mind that this license does not include the Relic Hunters Zero intellectual property, nor any of its image and audio files. You are also not authorized to distribute the game in any way.

This license was based on the Spelunky® User License v1.1b and the Artistic License 2.0.

Stay creative!
